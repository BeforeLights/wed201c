        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions.</p>

        <h2>Famous Anecdotes</h2>
        <h3>The Taxicab Number</h3>
        <p>One of the most famous anecdotes about Ramanujan involves the number 1729, now known as the Ramanujan-Hardy number. When the British mathematician G.H. Hardy visited Ramanujan in the hospital, he remarked that he had taken taxi number 1729, which seemed to him a rather dull number. Ramanujan immediately responded that it was actually a very interesting number mathematically, being the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Ramanujan's work has had a profound and wide-ranging impact in many areas of mathematics. His notebooks, containing summaries of his published and unpublished results, have been analyzed and studied by mathematicians for decades since his death, as a source of new mathematical ideas and inspiration.<br><a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ramanujan/" target="_blank">Illustration of Ramanujan's notebooks</a></p>
